# TipTac fixed for Shadowlands

Based on the [comments in the curse addon page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tip-tac#comments) I incorporated
the changes done by the user _Architekt909_ and _Vilogity_ in this repo in order to track the changes done
to the original addon.

I also removed a commented code block in the original addon that was causing an issue with mouse anchoring in buff frames.

## Installing this version of the addon with WowUp.io

In WowUp, go to Get Addons -> Install From URL and enter `https://github.com/enolgor/wow-addon-tiptac`, you will receive
automated updates for the issues that are being fixed.

## Manually Installation

Download from [here](https://github.com/enolgor/wow-addon-tiptac/archive/master.zip) the latest changes, open the zip and copy&paste the four tiptac folders inside the zip to the Interface/AddOns folder of the game.
